Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that begins after a traumatic event. That event may involve a real or perceived threat of injury or death. This can include, military combat, natural disaster, physical or sexual violence/abuse, accident, etc.
What are the symptoms of PTSD?
PTSD can disrupt your normal activities and your ability to function. Words, sounds, or situations that remind you of trauma can trigger your symptoms. Symptoms of PTSD include intrusion, avoidance, arousal and reactivity, anxious and depressed, easily startles, etc.
What causes PTSD?
PTSD can develop in people who’ve been through or witnessed a traumatic event like a natural disaster, military combat, or assault. While not everyone who experiences one of these events will develop PTSD, research is revealing that trauma may cause actual changes to the brain. More research is needed in this area. People diagnosed with PTSD may also have abnormal levels of stress hormones, which may set off an overreactive fight or flight response.
What are the types of PTSD?
PTSD is one condition, but some experts break it down into subtypes depending on a person’s symptoms, also known as condition “specifiers,” to make it easier to diagnose and treat. Some of the types are, Acute stress disorder, comorbid PTSD, uncomplicated PTSD, etc.
How to treat PTSD?
If you’re diagnosed with PTSD, your healthcare professional will likely prescribe therapy, medication, or a combination of the two treatments. In exposure therapy, you re-experience elements of the trauma in a safe environment. This can help desensitize you to the event and reduce your symptoms. Antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and sleep aids may help relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety. Two antidepressants are FDA-approved to treat PTSD: sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil).
